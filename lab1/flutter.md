# Introduction to [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)

## What's Flutter?

Flutter is Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

## His advantages

### Fast Development

Flutter's hot reload helps you quickly and easily experiment, build UIs, add features, and fix bugs faster. Experience sub-second reload times without losing state on emulators, simulators, and hardware.  [learn more](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/hot-reload)

### Expressive and Beautiful UIs

Delight your users with Flutter's built-in beautiful Material Design and Cupertino (iOS-flavor) widgets, rich motion APIs, smooth natural scrolling, and platform awareness.    [Browse the widget catalog](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets/catalog)

### Native Performance

Flutter’s widgets incorporate all critical platform differences such as scrolling, navigation, icons and fonts to provide full native performance on both iOS and Android.  [Examples of apps built with Flutter](https://flutter.dev/showcase)
